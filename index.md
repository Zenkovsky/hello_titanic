## Hi, I am Zenkovsky Ivan

I have been working in IT since 2014, studying in the 4th year of the university with a degree in applied mathematics and computer science. I started as a technical support employee and became a system administrator in less than a year. The next step was in pedagogy, I still teach programming, Python 3 and mathematical disciplines at the university and at the international school. Yes, I work in the secondary education system, where I trained the prize-winner and winner of the All-Russian Olympiad in Computer Science. Also  I develop educational IT-infrastructure at the university, where I was the CIO of the Faculty of Digital Technologies for 1.5 years, it was a great adventure, considering that this is a government organization and many ideas were implemented thanks to the patience of my department.
Now I have a new challenge - to become a cool Data Scientist. 
My slogans:
_Per aspera ad astra!_
_And To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield!_
